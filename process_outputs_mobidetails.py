output_mobidetails = '/Users/dianaavalos/Desktop/Tertiary_Research_Assignment/output/output_mobidetails'
output_filename = f"{output_mobidetails}_{iteration}.txt"

so we have many of these files
we want to concatenate them this way
tdf1 = pd.concat([tdf1, df_var], axis=0, ignore_index=True, sort=False)

need to extract and understanf failed variants
check that all the variants are present - which ones are missing
